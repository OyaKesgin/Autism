Decision Tree and Random Forest
Decision trees are prone to overfit but user can intpret easily. 
Random Forest: Can handle complex data set and not prone to overfit. Random forest can be interetable with feature importance feature and can be adjusted to work well on highly imbalanced data. 
Accuracy is not reliable performance when working with higly  imbalanced data.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to compare algorithms: Created by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings ( ROC= TP~FP)
